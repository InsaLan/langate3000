served by the [proxy (Caddy)](../caddy/). The frontend is responsible for displaying the data and
interacting with the backend.

## Contributing

Please read carefully [the CONTRIBUTING.md file](../CONTRIBUTING.md) before any

## Run the frontend in local

The frontend has to be deployed from the docker-compose setup (so you need to
install it!). Please refer to [this
README](../README.md) to install the docker-compose.

Once the docker-compose is running, you can access the frontend at
`http://beta.gate.localhost` if you are using the default beta configuration.
